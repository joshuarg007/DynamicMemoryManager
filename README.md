# DynamicMemoryManager
 "DynamicMemoryManager" is a C++ program demonstrating dynamic memory allocation and management using pointers. It prompts users to input three integers, stores them in variables, allocates memory dynamically for each using `new`, displays both the variables and their corresponding pointers, and properly deallocates memory using `delete`.
